          <p>The film I selected to make revolves around the concept of loneliness
             as it is represented on the NYUAD campus. Loneliness, despair, and
             homesickness are common sentiments among students. I wanted to emphasize
             this because the campus is constantly buzzing with events, parties,
             and gatherings, and no one really pays attention to the silent intervals
             between everything, much alone read the lines between the silence. This
             project aims to make students feel seen, heard, and know that they are not
             alone in this experience. Different emotions may arise while watching the film,
             and all feelings are welcome. The film's monologue attempts to capture the many
             voices inside someone's head as they navigate life on campus with the
             heavy burden of loneliness.
             I've seen many friends or classmates lock themselves in their dorm rooms
             and let all the negativity in. As a result, the repeated emphasis on
             "four walls, one room, one lock.” With this project, I hope to raise
             the student body's awareness of their peers' situations. This
             fosters empathy and understanding among the students.

          <p>This project is about a baseball's journey from earth to space. It
            is an interpretation of the more ironic end of the world. At the
            beginning, the baseball player hits the ball with all his strength
            and the ball travels beyond the earth's atmosphere, after which the
            ball collides with a meteor. Then, pieces of the meteor head toward
            earth and the player is horrified to witness the coming end of the
            world. While working on the comic, the goal was to create an
            experience for the viewers as if they were the main character.
            Some parts of the comic like "Click me" from the first scene create
            this feeling of central role in the storyline.

          <p> his website is built for those who are not used to the renwed D2
            this semester. I believe comsuming food is one of the most important
            experience one can have on this campus. Returning to school in two
            years, I was confused by the renewed counters and menu items when I
            first entered D2. For the first few days of the school, I had to read
            and ask about the menus before ordering any foods. And because of
            this, getting foods in D2 was often stressing. This would be true
            for other students who left the school before vendor changed or who
            is new to the school! To help those in my situation, I wanted to
            create an easily accessible virtual guide to D2, so no one has to ask
            each counter what they serve. Through this website, I hope students
            can have better sense of what food options they have in D2. The
            website had to be concise yet informative as much as possible, which
            was very challenging to find balance between the two. This website
            removes the students' needs to physically explore the D2, which I
            consider to be a waste of time and energy, so they can think about
            foods they want to eat even before they visit D2.

          <p>This pen plotter is a system that lets the user sketch a diagram or
            shape on the p5.js canvas. This sketch then will be used to control
            the physical arm of our drawing platform. To accomplish this, canvas
            data is sent from p5.js to Arduino, controlling different parts of
            the drawing device. The striking feature of the project is the
            interconnectivity of the drawing. The user can draw as many shapes
            or sketches as they desire, but everything will remain connected to
            each other. This idea is inspired by the Eulerian trail, where the
            floor is divided into multiple sections when multiple people step on it.
